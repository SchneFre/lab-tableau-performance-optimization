## Instructions

### Part 1: Performance Analysis 

1. **Record Performance** using Run Optimizer 

### Part 2: Optimize Your Workbook 

You may use the below proposed optimization steps or come up with your own approach.

Proposed optimization steps: 

   - **Data Optimization:**

      - Hide unused fields during extract creation
      - Add filters to reduce data volume where appropriate

   - **Visualization Optimization:**
      - For sheets with 1,000+ marks: Add Top N filters or date range filters
      - Replace complex scatter plots with heat maps or summary tables
      - Remove unnecessary calculated fields

   - **Dashboard Optimization:**
      - Replace global filters with dashboard actions where possible
      - Limit dashboards to 3-5 sheets maximum
      - Remove decorative elements that don't add analytical value

### Part 3: Test & Compare 
1. **Run new performance recording** following the same steps as Part 1
3. **Compare results:** Document improvement in load times
